Javascript basic project

This is my project for the Start2impact Javascript Basic course.
As you can see, it is a simple counter that I created using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Steps for creating the project:
 1. Creation of html templates
 2. Create buttons and headers with Javascript
 3. Added elements created to html
 4. Added the events to the buttons and created the function to update the display
 5. Stylized everything with css
